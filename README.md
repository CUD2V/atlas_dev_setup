# Atlas dev setup

## About 
Builds and installs [OHDSI ATLAS](https://www.ohdsi.org/atlas-a-unified-interface-for-the-ohdsi-tools/) in a VM.  
Mainly intended to help with setting up for development. Still very much a work in progress. 

## Dependencies
* [ansible 2.7+](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
* [Vagrant 2.2.2](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)
* [Virtual Box 5.2.22](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)

## Running
### Local environment
* `vagrant up`
* Once ansible finishes: 
    * Atlas will be running at [http://192.168.33.10:8080/atlas/](http://localhost:8080/atlas/)
    
* syncing is disabled until the provisioner finishes. To sync the source folders once the provisioner finishes run `vagrant reload`. The source code for the various projects used in Atlas can be found on the host machine under `src`

### Server
* The playbook can also be used to deploy Atlas to a remote server.  
    * copy either of the existing provisioning directories (`tests` or `vagrant`)
    * update any variables needed in the `group_vars` directory
    * update the ip addresses of the various components in the inventory file, and the location of the ssh keys
    * Then run the playbook `ansible-playbook -i provisioning/server/inventory configure.yml --become`
        * This assumes that the ssh user came run commands as `sudo`
